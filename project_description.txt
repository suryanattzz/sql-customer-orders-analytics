Project: Customer Orders Schema and Reporting

Use Case
Build a database schema for customers, products, orders, and order_items. 
Each table must contain a minimum of 100 records with realistic data (e.g., varying dates, cities, and categories).

Table Structure

- customers: customer_id, first_name, last_name, email, phone, city, created_at

- products: product_id, product_name, category, price, cost, created_at

- orders: order_id, customer_id, order_date, status, total_amount

- order_items: order_item_id, order_id, product_id, quantity, unit_price, line_total


Concepts & Milestones

- Concepts: Table design, keys, SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, Aggregations (GROUP BY), and simple views.
- Milestones: Create tables with constraints, load sample data, and maintain data integrity.

Required Reports

- Revenue by day/week.
- Top 5 products by revenue and quantity.
- Identification of customers with no orders.
- Customer classification (Repeat vs. One-Time).
- Customer lifetime value and top 5 revenue-generating customers.
- Views for recurring reports.

Stretch Goals

- ERD diagram.
- Indexes for frequently queried columns.

Deliverables

1. SQL scripts (schema, inserts, and queries).
2. Report outputs in CSV format.
3. A README file explaining your approach.
